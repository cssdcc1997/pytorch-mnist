# Designer: lyf
# It attain quiet great results. The accuracy is 99.36%
# Design idea:
#     use small convolution kernel as much as i can
#     small convolution kernel (3 * 3) can reduce the parameters nums
#     And i use convolution with stride 2 to replace the max pooling
#     In the classifier, i use dropout to prevent the overfitting
#     In addition, i choose the input channel and output channel carefully
#     The channel should be a multiple or power of 2.
